# Hattara Printable Low Profile Keycaps

3D Printable Low Profile MX/Choc V1 Keycaps, designed to be printed with SLS, MJF or resin printers on sites like JLCPCB and PCBWay. The tolerances have been tested to work with SLS but I can't promise they'll work with other manufacturing methods. Let me know if you order these in MJF or Resin, and how they fit.

## Versions

* Choc V1 keycaps with Choc Spacing (prefix "Choc-cs" in filenames, 17.45 x 16.45mm)
* Choc V1 keycaps with MX Spacing (prefix "Choc-mxs" in filenames, 17.9 x 17.9mm)
* MX keycaps (prefix "MX" in filenames, 17.9 x 17.9mm, 0.5mm taller than Choc caps)

All keyboards that support both Choc and MX switches are designed with MX spacing. Most keyboards that only support Choc switches are designed with Choc spacing, but always check as there are exceptions. If you want to play it safe, get Choc spacing keycaps. They'll fit on MX spacing boards too but will leave bigger gaps between keys.

## Included sizes

* 1u
* 1.25u
* 1.5u
* ISO Enter
* Homing keys (6 variants)

1.75u, 2u, 2.25u and 2.75u keycaps coming Soonâ„¢.

## Please note

* Try to only insert the MX caps one way (sprue gate facing to the rear). Inserting them sideways may loosen them due to the asymmetry of some switch stems. If a keycap has been loosened it will need to be used in the sideways position from that point onward. The profile is uniform so this will only affect the position of the sprue gate but still something to keep in mind.

* Choc keycaps with Choc spacing don't include an ISO enter keycap as they're completely unstandardized. The MX spacing Choc ISO enter will fit on boards like PRKL30 that have MX spacing and a sideways enter switch.

* Choc caps don't include stabilizer stems.

* The files include individual caps as well as sprues. I highly recommend using the sprues as this ensures the parts meet the common minimum price per part on sites like JLCPCB, at least for SLS and MJF.

* JLCPCB accepts both .obj and .stp, but in my experience .obj results in higher fidelity due to how they convert .stp files into meshes. The .stp files are included mostly for remix purposes.

* The automatic file checker on JLC/etc will probably complain about 0.8mm thin walls, just say you're ok with it. From my testing it has no effect on print quality.
