# Printable Choc Caps
3D Printable Choc V1 keycaps, designed to be printed on Resin, SLS or MJF printers on sites like JLCPCB. The tolerances have been tested to work with SLS but i can't promise they'll work with other manufacturing methods. Let me know if you order these in MJF or Resin, and how they fit.

Included sizes:
* 1u
* 1.25u
* 1.5u
* ISO Enter (sideways switch)

These files include individual caps as well as sprues. I highly recommend using the sprues as this ensures the parts meet the common minimum price per part on sites like JLCPCB, at least for SLS and MJF.

JLCPCB accepts both .obj and .stp, but in my experience .obj results in higher fidelity due to how they convert .stp files into meshes. The .stp files are included mostly for remix purposes.
